In this problem the first state of the gene is given and the last state of the gene is given no we have to find the mutation sequence from the given bank to get the final sequence. We have 4 fundamental blocks. We can use either of them in mutation to build the sequence.

We can use the python set to find if the mutation is in the sequence bank. And a path set with traversed sequence.

we can do bfs.
